                Trading cryptocurrencies carries a high level of risk and may not be suitable for all investors.
Before deciding to trade cryptocurrency, you should carefully consider your investment
objectives, level of experience, and risk appetite. The possibility exists that you could sustain a
loss of some or all your initial investment and therefore you should not invest money that you
cannot afford to lose. You should be aware of all the risks associated with cryptocurrency trading
and seek advice from an independent financial advisor. ICO's, IEO's, STO's and any other form
of offering will not guarantee a return on your investment.
